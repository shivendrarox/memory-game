# MemoryGame
A memory game inspired from Udacity's Memory game project for front end nanodegree.
The game begins when you click any card, the timer begins, your moves are recorded and checked whether the cards match or not. depending on this the game does further tasks like updating stars etc. the game has a reset button which reloads the page, allowing game to be reset such that the player is not able to cheat, as the pattern of cards always changes after refresh.
